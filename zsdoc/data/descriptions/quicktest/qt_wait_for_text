# This is way more useful than the above, as it waits for a specific
# piece of text to appear on the screen. We take a screenshot and then
# use tessaract to OCR the text. We can then search for the text in the
# resulting output. We can also invert the image and try again, as some
# text might be hard for tesseract to read in the default format.
# Note that we also specify a number of retries and an interval between
# each try. This is useful because people have different speed computers
# making it hard to know when a task is done. So we just do what a human does,
# and look at the screen until we see what we want.
# For a long running event like an install doing copying of files, which may take
# 10 minutes or more, perhaps have 10 retries with a 60 second interval.
